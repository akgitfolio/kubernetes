A simple job in Kubernetes, referred to as a Job, is used to create one or more pods that will run to completion. Unlike a CronJob, which schedules jobs to run at specific times, a Job will run immediately when created and can be used for tasks that need to be run to completion, such as data processing or database migrations.
