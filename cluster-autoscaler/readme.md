Cluster Autoscaler in Kubernetes automatically adjusts the size of the cluster, adding nodes when there are pending pods that cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources and removing nodes when they are underutilized and their pods can be rescheduled on other nodes. This helps optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

Cloud Provider Support: Cluster Autoscaler works with several cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, and Azure. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is running on a supported cloud provider and has the necessary permissions to manage the infrastructure.
